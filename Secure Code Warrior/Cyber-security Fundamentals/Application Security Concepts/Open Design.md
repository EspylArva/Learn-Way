# Open design
## Context
Security by obscurity is not security: for example, using non-default ports, or hiding an api route thinking only admins know it
## Danger
Enables easy attacks if attackers understand the structure or scan it
## Counter measures
- Design and implement security measures
- Obscurity can be used, but should not be the main defence
