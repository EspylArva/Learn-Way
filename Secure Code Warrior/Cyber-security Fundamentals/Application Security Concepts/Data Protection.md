# Data Protection
## Context
Sensitive data is badly handled by an application
## Danger
Confidential data could be retrieved by attacker
## Counter measures
- Store information if needed only
- Do not hardcode secret information
- Do not store credentials, encryption, or sensitive information keys in plain text
- Use secure communication channels to send data
- Inform users and developers about the security measures taken
- Obfuscate source code of application
- Use [[Defense in depth|multiple]] layers to protect data
- Hiding information using [[Open Design|obscurity]] is not enough
