# Reuse of Existing Security Controls in a framework or language
## Context
Development of an application or feature
## Danger
Adding more and more code on an existing code base spreads the surface of attack points
## Counter measures
- Clean coding reduces risk of duplicate code, and thus reduces risk of unfixed bugs
- KISS when developing things
- Use proven code, frameworks and libraries
- Educate on best practices and design patterns
