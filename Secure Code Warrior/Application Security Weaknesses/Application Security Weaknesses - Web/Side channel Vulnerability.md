# Side Channel Vulnerability
## Timing Attack
### Context
An application has various input and output points. Timing attack occur when attackers take advantage of the difference in response time
### Danger
Attackers could take advantage of a flaw of [[Business Logic]] to bypass a verification due to a difference of response timing
### Counter Measures
- Test the application with timing-based tests
- When actions taking a long time are executed, ensure other actions are synchronised if needed
- If required, create dummy values to display and refresh to make up for significant time differences
## URL caching (Cache Leak)
### Context
When application usually use cache to speed up user navigation. This can lead to URL caching vulnerability if the cache contains sensitive information.
If the data is hosted on the same device or server, other users could be able to retrieve the cache file, and this sensitive data
### Danger
Attackers could gain access to sensitive information
### Counter Measures
- Avoid storing [[Data Protection|unnecessary user data]]
- Use encryption to obfuscate sensitive user information
- Use cache-control headers
## Data sent to 3rd parties
### Context
Developers sometimes send data to third parties for data analysis, bug fixing, or other services.
This can leave the application or the data open for attacks if the data and data transmission is not securely implemented
### Danger
Sensitive data could be retrieved by attackers, or the application ports could be revealed and attacked
### Counter Measures
- Catalog and audit all 3rd party applications
- Record and log sensitive information to understand if, how, and why it is being shared
- Set up secure multi-level [[Access Control|access controls]] on data
- Update [[Threat Modelling]] models
